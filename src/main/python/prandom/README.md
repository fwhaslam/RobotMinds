Numeric Representation:
Embdedding is out, then we would have to train on EVERY number.
binary ?  Then we only have to train on each bit in our maximum number.

Step One:  Train against simple PRNG

Step Two: Create GAN with discriminator trying to predict generator. ( imbalanced training? )

RNN vs FFT?  ( epicycles? )

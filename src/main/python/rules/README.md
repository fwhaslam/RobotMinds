What is this?
=============

The concept is simple.  I want to train the NN using rules instead of examples.

What I have in mind is to tell it about maps for a game.  Instead of giving examples, 
I will apply rules that judge the quality of the output.  Will this be an effective 
technique?  I have no idea.  So far so good.

Step one: land and sea = generate a map similar to old school strategy maps, 
    with just two types of terrain.  The rules specify the ratios I want to see,
    and the amount of 'surface' (eg. coastline )
